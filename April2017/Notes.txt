Peter,

Here’s the slides for the User’s Group. Feel free to tweak them as you like especially the what’s new section. I added a few but you will probably want to add more or remove some of the ones I added. Lots happened in late March on the Azure blog.

Feel free to introduce yourself at the beginning and you can mention that I had a family event he had to attend to. 

I added a note about Open EDX in the What’s new section to see if we can pre-empt the guy in the back who knows of a class for every azure subject ever heard of and they all seem to be on Open EDX :0)

Towards the end of the slides I have a slide for introducing Dallen. 

You can say something like:
This is Dallen Campbell. He’s the Vice President of Service Delivery for Uncommon Solutions . Uncommon Solutions started the Mile High Azure User’s Group and has been a huge supporter of the group ever since. Dallen is going to start helping Nathan and myself lead the group and meetings and he wanted to chat with everyone and ask a few questions. 

Thanks for covering for me!
